<p><span class="date">201-200</span> Xiognu chanyu Modu encourages the Shanxi king to rebel, providing a route into Han territory. Han emperor Gaozu is defeated in battle and almost killed.</p>
<p>The Xiongu population is less than 1.5 million adults, compared to Han 60 million, but they are able to field armies of the same size as the Han. </p>
<p><span class="date">198</span> Gaozu recognises the Xiongnu as equals, and institutes the <i lang="zh-Latn">heqin</i> policy (annual tribute from the Chinese for cessation of Xiognu raids). This lasts (with interruptions) for 60 years.</p>
<p><span class="date">176</span> Modu Chanyu reports to Han Wendi that his king of the right has wiped out the Yuezhi, and conquered the Loulan, Wusun and Huquie tribes, as well as 26 neighbouring states. He claims that the entire northern region (the people who live by drawing the bow) are now at peace.</p>
<p><span class="date">173</span> The remnant of the Yuezhi, who had been driven to the south west, attack their north-western neighbours, the Wusun, driving them out of north-east Xianjiang and north-west Gansu. They kill the Wusun king Nantoumi, and the Wusun flee to the Xiongnu.</p>
<p><span class="date">162</span> Xiongnu chanyu Laoshang defeats the Yuezhi, killing their king. The majority of the Yuezhi flee to the Ili valley or Lake Issyk Kul, and smaller numbers to the Qiang, or to the area between Turfan and Kucha.</p>
