<p>Date is derived by comparing portrayed states against a timeline of the ten kingdoms. The window appears to be between CE 43-45, due to the presence of the Yin kingdom, so I dated the map as CE 944. The source map doesn't close the western border of Khitan-Liao, or the southern border of the Southern Han, so I made a guess and followed the modern borders of China.</p>
