<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The map in the Atlas of World History was slightly out. It was more of a match for 409 CE, except that it didn't mention the Later Qin. The Liang arrangement in Talessman's Atlas was also rather strange. There are two versions of his AD 400 map (both from 2008) and significantly different. I used the later one in general, but rearranged the Liang states.</p>
