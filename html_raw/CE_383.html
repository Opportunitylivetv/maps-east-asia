<p><span class="date">365</span> Murong Ke and the Former Yan capture Luoyang.</p>
<p><span class="date">373</span> The Former Qin launch a campaign against Jin's western region, and conquers modern Sichuan, Chongqing and southern Shaanxi.</p>
<p><span class="date">376</span> The Former Qin defeat and absorb the Former Liang state. </p>

<p><span class="date">380</span>  Former Qin's Fú Jiān spreads out his Di people throughout the empire, leaving Guangzhong with very few Di, but many Xianbei and Qiang, which would eventually have a destabilising effect.</p>
<p><span class="date">383</span> The Former Qin suffer a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Fei River or “Feishui”, against the Jin. The aftermath of the battle includes the Former Qin empire falling into massive civil war and its eventual destruction.</p>
