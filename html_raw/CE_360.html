<section class="timeline">
  <p><span class="date">291-306</span> A series of civil wars, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Eight_Princes">Rebellion of the Eight Princes</a>, significantly weakens the Jin state.</p>
  <p><span class="date">301-3</span> Li family generals fight against  Luo Shang, Jin governer of Yi province (modern Shichuan and Chongqing).</p>
<p><span class="date">304</span>  Li Xiong captures Chengdu, capital of Yi province,  Luo Shang flees, and in 306 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Han">Cheng</a> state is founded.</p>
<p>After a request for help from a Jin prince in Hebei, Liu Yuan, chief of the Southern Xiongnu (based in Ordos, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia), reorganises the 5 Xiongnu tribes in Shanxi and declares himself King of Han. This is the start of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Zhao">Former Zhao</a> or Han Zhao state. The initial capital (of 6) is Lishi (LÃ¼liang, Shanxi).</p>
<p><span class="date">305</span> Former Zhao capital moved to Liting (Changzhi, Shanxi) after a famine. Despite success against other armies, they are unable to hold on to other cities, and their control is still limited to the immediate area around the capital.</p>
<p><span class="date">308</span> Former Zhao capital moved to Puzi (Linfen, Shanxi) after capturing more territory.</p>
<p><span class="date">309</span> Former Zhao capital moved to Pingyang (also Linfen, Shanxi). The Former Zhao now occupy all of southern Shanxi.</p>
<p><span class="date">311</span> The Jin are driven from Luoyang by the Xiongnu under Liu Cong, with capital at Pingyang.</p>
<p><span class="date">313</span> Zhang Gui,   Han governor of Liangzhou, founds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Liang">Former Liang</a> in modern-day Gansu. However, the date of independence from the Jin, with capital at Guzang (Wuwei, Gansu) and territories including present-day Gansu and parts of Ningxia, Shaanxi, Qinghai and Xinjiang, is not clear: some put it in 314-5 with his son Zhang Shi, others 320, when Zhang Mao issued a pardon for people in his domain.</p>
<p>Jin general Zu Ti recaptures a large swathe of Henan south of the Yellow river, repeatedly defeating the Later Zhao forces.</p>
<p><span class="date">315</span> Tuoba Yilu, a Xianbei chieftain of the  Tuoba clan sets up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_(Sixteen_Kingdoms)">Dai</a> state, with its capital at Shengle (just south of Hohot).</p>
<p><span class="date">316</span> The Jin are driven from Chang'an by the Former Zhao and become the Eastern Jin, south of the Yangtse (from 317), with their capital at Jiankang (Nanjing). They are joined by millions of refugees from the north.</p>
<p><span class="date">318</span> Former Zhao capital moved to Chang'an.</p>
<p><span class="date">319</span> Han Zhao general Shi Le breaks away and forms the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Zhao">Later Zhao</a> state, with capital at Xiangguo (Xingtai, Hebei). It will eventually control much of northern China.</p>
<p><span class="date">321</span> During a Jin rebellion Later Zhao take back Henan.</p>
<p><span class="date">327</span> Zhang Gui of the Former Liang creates the Gaochang commandery, resulting in significant Han settlement in the area.</p>
<p><span class="date">329</span> Former Zhao capital moved to Shanggui (Tianshui, Gansu). Later Zhao's Shi Le terminates the Former Zhao state by defeating Liu Yao at the river Luo.</p>
<p><span class="date">335</span> Shi Hu moves the capital of the Later Zhao state to Yecheng.</p>
<p><span class="date">337</span> After defeating his brother the previous winter, Murong Huang claims the title title of Prince of Yan, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Yan">Former Yan</a> state begins, with its capital at Jicheng (Beijing).</p>
<p><span class="date">338</span> Li Shou renames Cheng as Han, though historians treat Cheng Han as a single kingdom.</p>
<p>Tuoba Shiyijian declares Dai independent and builds a capital at Shengle (Horinger County, Hohhot).</p>
<p><span class="date">341</span> Murong Huang moves the Former Yan capital to Longcheng (modern Zhaoyang).</p>
<p><span class="date">346-7</span> Later Zhao forces attempt to conquer Former Liang, seizing land south of the Yellow River, including Lanzhou, but are stopped. The land south of the river, however, is lost.</p>
<p><span class="date">347</span> Jin general Huan Wen defeats the last Cheng emperor, and Cheng Han reverts to Jin.</p>
<p><span class="date">350</span> Shi Min, de facto ruler of the Later Zhao and Han by birth (adopted nephew of a Zhao emperor), rallies the Han population and incites them to massacre over 200,000 non Han (especially Jie). Di chief, Pu/Fu Hong, based in Fangtou (Hebi, Henan), is one of the generals resisting Shi Min.</p>
<p> Shi Min changes his name back to his father's surname Ran, kills the Later Zhao emperor, and founds his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran_Min">Wei</a> state. In the ensuing struggle, Jin and especially Former Yan states begin appropriating parts of the Former Zhao state, including modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei. The Ran Wei capital is Yecheng (Handan, Hebei).</p>
<p>After his death Pu/Fu Hong's son Fu Jian captures Chang'an in the winter.</p>
<p><span class="date">351</span> Liu Xian, Former Zhao general sent to fight Ran Wei, kills his own emperor instead, and proclaims himself emperor. </p>
<p>Fu Jian, seizes the western part of Later Zhao, and establishes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Qin">Former Qin</a> state. He is unopposed because the Zhao emperor is busy fighting the Wei. </p>
<p>The southern provinces switch allegiance to Jin.</p>
<p>The Former Yan moves south.</p>
<p><span class="date">352</span> Ran Min captures Xiangguo and kills Liu Xian. This is the end of the Later Zhao. Ran Min attacks the Former Yan, but is captured and killed. Ran Wei soon afterwards collapses.</p>
<p><span class="date">354</span> Jin general Huan Wen briefly retakes Chang'an from the Former Qin.</p>
<p><span class="date">355-6</span> Murong Jun of the Former Yan beseiges and conquers Duan Kan at Guanggu (Qingzhou, Shandong).</p>
<p><span class="date">356</span> Jin general Huan Wen takes Luoyang from Qiang chief Yao Xiang.</p>
<p><span class="date">357</span> The Former Yan move their capital from Jicheng (Beijing) to Yecheng (Handan, Hebei).</p>
<p><span class="date">359</span> Jin forces attack the Former Yan, but are defeated, allowing the Former Yan to gradually take over the Henan region, south of the Yellow river.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>I was unable to find a source map for this period, so I constructed this map by listing known places associated with each kingdom around 360 CE, and then drawing lines around them. There was particularly little information about the Dai kingdom.</p>
